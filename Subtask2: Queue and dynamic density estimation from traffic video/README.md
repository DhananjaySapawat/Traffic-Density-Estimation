# Subtask2 #
## How to Run the Code:
1 Launch the terminal and give the command make run.
2 Put the video for which you want queue density and dynamic density (sample video is present).
3 Run the following commands in the terminal from the directory of the project folder.

   --make 
   --./subtask2 (VideoName)(VideoName is name of file of which you want to find queue density and dynamic density and it must be presented in extaracted folder).

4 You should get output in both terminal and out.txt.( you get three columns in which first was time,second was queue density and third was dynamic density)

5 Run the following commands in the terminal to plot the graph of densities.
   >> make dqgraph.

## Description of the code:
   The code will take such a video as input and output the queue density (blue line in the graph below) and dynamic density (orange line) for the video frames.
